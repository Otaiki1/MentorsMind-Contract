## 5. Known Limitations & Accepted Risks

### 5.1 Documented Limitations

All limitations are fully documented in threat model and trust assumptions:

1. **Single Admin Key** (v1.0)

   - Risk: Single point of failure
   - Mitigation: Hardware wallet requirement
   - Future: Multi-sig in v1.1

2. **No Emergency Pause**

   - Risk: Cannot freeze all operations instantly
   - Mitigation: Fee increase deterrent, refund mechanism
   - Rationale: Soroban best practices favor explicit controls

3. **Admin-Controlled Verification**

   - Risk: Centralized process
   - Mitigation: On-chain audit trail, process controls
   - Note: Required for KYC/compliance

4. **Simple Token Allowance**

   - Risk: No expiration on approvals
   - Mitigation: Acceptable for MVP
   - Future: Enhancement possible

5. **Symbol Length Limitation**
   - Risk: Dispute reasons limited to 6 chars
   - Mitigation: Predefined reason codes
   - Impact: Minor UX limitation

### 5.2 Accepted Economic Risks

1. **Fee Cap at 10%**

   - Acceptable: Market standard is 2-5%
   - Headroom allows future increases if needed

2. **Auto-Release Default 72h**

   - Balanced: Enough time for disputes
   - Configurable: Can be adjusted at initialization

3. **USDC Freezing Risk**
   - Acknowledged: Centralized stablecoin risk
   - Mitigation: Diversify approved tokens in future

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY DISCLOSED** — All limitations documented
